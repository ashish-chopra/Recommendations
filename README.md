Recommendations
=================

Recommendations is a design prototype to carry out the formal methods of evaluation in Human-Computer Interaction 
to gather feedback. This is an early stage prototype and is not intended to be used for production level deployment.

What is it?
============

Recommendations is an online prototype designed for studying formal methods of Design thinking. This solution is used to
search various products under different categories and look for their user reviews crowdscourced from online community,
their feedback ratings, prices from various online sellers. Users can also compare their prices and ratings. This is 
designed to alleviate the problems faced by users going to buy new products in the market and paralysed with the numerous
choices.

The scope of this design brief is very vast, but in order to complete this study, the scope has been reduced to specific 
constraints which are implemented in this prototype. A help guide is also included in the prototype to accompain user 
with the scope.

A working prototype is hosted for evaluation [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/88867846/Recommendations/index.html).
